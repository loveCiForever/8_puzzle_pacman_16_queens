# Group Midterm Project

Welcome to our midterm project repository! This project showcases our solutions to three algorithmic problems using advanced AI and search techniques.

## Project Overview

### 1. 8-Puzzle Solver (A*)
An implementation of the A* search algorithm to efficiently solve the classic 8-puzzle problem — a sliding puzzle that challenges spatial reasoning and heuristic optimization.

### 2. Pacman Pathfinding (A*)
A simulation of the Pacman game where the A* algorithm is applied to enable intelligent navigation through a grid with walls and food pellets.

### 3. 16-Queens Solver (Genetic Algorithm)
A creative solution to the 16-Queens problem using genetic algorithms — demonstrating evolutionary principles to place 16 queens on a chessboard without conflicts.
